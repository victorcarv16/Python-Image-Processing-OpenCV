<h1> Wooded Area Tracker </h1> 
> Status: Developing⚠️

### PDI image processing programs.

## This is software to track wooded areas (green) on any GoogleMaps image.

### To perform the image treatment I used the following processes:

+ Filters
+ color space conversion
+ tracking
+ binarization
+ thresholding
+ contour counting 
+ multiple centers of mass and graphical interface.


# For this project it will be necessary to upload an image of a wooded location (with green vegetation), and a photo with the respective scale that was used.

## In this project I used the following technologies (libraries):
<table> 
  <tr>
    <td>Python</td>
    <td>OpenCV</td>
    <td>Numpy</td>
    <td>Tkinter</td>
    <td>mahotas</td>
    <td>matplotlib</td>
    <td> OS</td>
    <td>colorysys</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td> 3.*</td>
    <td> 2</td>
    <td> 1</td>
    <td> 1</td>
